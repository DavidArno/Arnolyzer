Inner types that are marked `internal` or `public` are likely doing one (or, in some cases, both) of two things:

1. They are using the outer class as a namespace label,
2. They are exposing the inner workings of the outer class, thus weakening encapsulation.

In the first case, the type should be moved to its own file in an appropriate directory to give it a proper namespace name.

In the latter case, either the type should be made `private`, to properly encapsulate the inner workings of the outer class, or the two types should be redesigned and the inner type moved to its own file and marked as `internal` or `public` as appropriate.
