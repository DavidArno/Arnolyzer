Static methods that take an input, and generate a deterministic output from that input, without having any side-effects are termed 
pure functions. These methods are thread-safe and easy to test.

Methods that do not take any parameters, do not meet the critia of a pure function: they will have side-effects as they must derive
a result from external resources. These methods are likely to not be thread-safe or easy to test as a result. Therefore methods 
without parameters should not be made static.
