# Liskov Substitution Principle Analyzers #
From the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) article on Wikipedia:
> Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming. It states that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S(i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program(correctness, task performed, etc.)
