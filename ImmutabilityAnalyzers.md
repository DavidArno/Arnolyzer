# Immutability Analyzers #
A badly named variable that has many values written to it over the course of a long-winded method makes for hard-to-read, and hard-to-mentally-trace, code. Variables that only written to once both make for easier reading, as a new appropriately named variable must be created for each assignment. They create easier to understand code as they help maintain the principle of least surprise.
