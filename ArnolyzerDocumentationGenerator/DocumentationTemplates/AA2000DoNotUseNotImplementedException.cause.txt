From the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) (LSP) article on Wikipedia:
> Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming. It states that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e., objects of type S may substitute objects of type T) without altering any of the desirable properties of that program (correctness, task performed, etc.)

A subtype (or interface implementation) that throws a `NotImplementedException` cannot be used as a substitute to its parent "without altering any of the desirable properties of that program". Therefore the use of this exception is a violation of the  LSP.
